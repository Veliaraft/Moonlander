Lunar Lander remake on Godot Engine

YALAAAA, my dear friend!

I'm glad you stopped by here.

I made it on Godot 3.5.1

Although my task was to make a remake of LunarLander (I do not claim intellectual property, the rights belong to the owner of the original product. This game was created as a homework assignment on the subject of "Game Development"), I tried to make it at least not disgusting, so that you would be pleased to open it.

Download Godot on Steam faster, take this project for yourself, and open it in Godot! Use it - this project is especially for you!

Thank you for being here, for being there, and for coming here. I am pleased! You're so breathtaking!

And many thanks to the developers of the Godot game engine!

# HOW TO PLAY

Your task is to land a ship on the moon. For this:
- You can only get up on specially designated parking spaces (platforms).
- The horizontal landing speed should not exceed 2 modulo.
- The vertical landing speed should not exceed 3 modulo.
- The angle of rotation should not exceed 5 degrees modulo.

Controls:
- Up arrow - acceleration in the direction of the rocket.
- Left/right arrow - turn the rocket.

!!! Acceleration in the direction opposite to the rocket movement is used as a brake.

!!!Gravity exists and acts constantly.

Good luck and have fun!
